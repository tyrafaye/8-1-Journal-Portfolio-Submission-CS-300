In Project One, I looked at how different data structures, like arrays and binary search trees, work in terms of speed and memory use. This meant seeing how fast they process data and how much memory they need. In Project Two, I created a program to sort and print a list of Computer Science courses in alphabetical and numerical order. I used various data structures to make the program work better and use less memory.
When I ran into problems, I looked for answers online, asked classmates and teachers for help, and tried different methods until I found a solution. These experiences taught me that understanding data structures is very important for handling data well in software development. I learned to pick the right data structure based on the problem, which helped me design better software.
Working on these projects also helped me write clearer and more understandable code. I now document my code better and use clear names for variables, making my programs easier to read and maintain. I also think about how my code can be reused and changed for future projects, making it more flexible.
These projects changed how I design and develop software. They showed me the importance of handling data efficiently and using the right data structures. The challenges I faced improved my problem-solving skills and my ability to write code that is easy to maintain and adapt. This reflection helps me see my progress and will be useful in the future.
